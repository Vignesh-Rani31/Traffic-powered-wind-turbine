# Traffic-powered-wind-turbine
A sustainable energy project capturing wind energy from moving vehicles using a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT).
##  Key Highlights

- Designed a mini VAWT to harness traffic-induced wind
- Modeled and tested blade design with 3D printing
- Observed power generation performance with charts
- Low-cost, eco-friendly, and scalable idea

##  Charts & Performance Data
See `/charts/` folder for:
- Wind Speed vs Voltage
- Wind Speed vs RPM
- Time vs Energy Output
